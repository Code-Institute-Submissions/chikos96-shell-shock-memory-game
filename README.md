# shell-shock-memory-game
My second project will be based on a memory card game. The theme will be my favourite cartoon group known
as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an interactive game.

## User Experience
    
- UX Design

This game is for user that to play games. The Memory Game is the most suitable game because the user gets to
find all the cards to match. It is fun and interactive for all users. It will be in a single page format.

### User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to click all the cards.
- As a user, I want to be able to get some scores.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how much time did i match my cards.
- As a user, I want to play the game again.
- As a user, i want to understand easily about the functionality of the game.

### Design
 - Color Scheme
     -   The main colors I used are green and black.
- Typography
      -  I used Cambria font style. 
- Imagery
    -  I found the image on the website to find the characters that everyone likes. These images could attract the user's attention.

## Wireframe
This is the wireframe that i did for desktop, mobile and tablet. It shows my explanation on how my website should be.

## Testing

First I have validated my website using the W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator to see if there were any errors. 
I even used DevTools to check how my website is doing and to see if there are any bugs. 
So far the website has no bugs and no errors.
